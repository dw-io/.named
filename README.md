# dotnamed
A simple framework for setting up DNS on a mac.

INSTALL
===========

Clone repository to ~/.named.  If you want to install elsewhere, that is fine, but you'll need to change the first line of named.sh to reflect the new location.

git clone git@github.com:dw-io/dotnamed.git ~/.named
source ~/.named/named.sh
named_configure

This should install and start named.
